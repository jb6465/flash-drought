In attendance: David Hoffman, Tess Parker, Jess Bhardwaj, Hanh Nguyen, Mike Hobbins, Pallavi Goswami, James Risbey
- Interest in flash drought for all of us and esp for ACS flash drought
- Tess mentioned it would be nice to have a coordinated effort when it comes to flash drought in Australia
- Hanh weather system analysis - so far she used Acacia's 10 different storm/weather types using ESI to define flash drought 
- Interest in calculating EDDI with reanalyses (ERA5 and BARRA for Australia)
- Thinking of ways we can pull together a cohesive collaboration for all of us
- Mike:
  - Flash drying/rapid drying phase interesting because it removes the idea of a drought having an impact to be a drought
  - More scientific and easier to define than the definition of a drought
  - Decomposition of the evaporative demand side of drought
- Hanh - Always the question of index selection - Hanh has Standardised Evaporative Stress Ration (SESR) pentad window calculated by Jordan? From ERA5 and MERRA2
- Mike mentioned SESR better than ED index they explored in Aspen ?
- Hanh - looking at the intensification phase / potential for flash drought, could be useful to give it a new/other name
- James - thatâ€™s why we call it 'flash dry'
- Hanh is trying to look at the relationship between flash drought onset and cessation related to weather/synoptic patterns
- Mike working with someone from Penn State who has used the term "thirstwave" - points to other drivers of flash drought beyond heat alone, an interesting analysis would be to decompose these anomalies in evaporative demand - opportunity to diagnose causal factors (how much and where it is important)
- Pallavi linked [this study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969722050227) - mentioned that the causal factors and signatures of each event are different
- Tess mentioned it is like looking at the "DNA" of drought
- Potential for compound event research w heat/fire aspects of flash drought (useful for ACS)
- James mentioned clustering analysis as a tool for this analysis
- Tess said could be really interesting, which would really complement what Hanh is doing
- David mentioned what drought hazard team is working on - projections of drought in different global warming levels - potential to look at the flash drought index we select in a future climate
- Tess - one of the problems is the components of EDDI may not  be available / reliable from GCM/RCM outputs??
- ERA5-Land might be better for land based modelling
- Tess interested to pursue decomposition algorithms
